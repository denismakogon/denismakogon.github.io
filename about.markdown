Hi, my name is Denys Makogon. I am a Principal member of technical stuff at Oracle.
I work at Java Platform Group - an amazing family responsible for development of most-used programming langauge - Java!

<h4>
So, obviously, I am a Java fanboy, 95$ % of time I explore the JDK, 
5% - I do open source, pretty effectively in various ecosystems beyond Java.

I'll try to keep posting constant as there are so many thing I'd like to show you!
