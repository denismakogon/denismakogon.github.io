![me](_images/about/me_copy.jpg)

Hi, my name is Denys Makogon. I am a Principal member of technical stuff at Oracle.
I'm Java fanboy, 95$ % of time I explore the JDK, 5% of time I automate whatever makes me feel uncomfortable.
Also, I am a blogger, landscape photographer (Best Photo in 2019 by 35Awards), traveler.
